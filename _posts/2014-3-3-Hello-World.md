title: Build a Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
---

In starting this blog, one of the first questions I considered was which blogging platform I would use.  My initial top choice was WordPress, but in the end I decided to go with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  If you&#39;re familiar with GitHub, Jekyll is a great blogging platform that provides simplicity and speed.

##### Content Management System (CMS) or Static Website
WordPress and other similar platforms are Content Management Systems (CMS) that use databases to store content.  Content Management Systems are very powerful applications, but if you only need a static site, like I did for my blog, CMS dynamic code and database calls can unnecessarily slow down loading time.

On the other hand, Jekyll is a static blog generator that compiles all files into static HTML before publication and has no database, which is great for loading speed.  Essentially, Jekyll is a minimalist platform, with the bonus of free GitHub Pages hosting.  If you don&#39;t need the added complexity of a dynamic website, Jekyll is a solid choice.
